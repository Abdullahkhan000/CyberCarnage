This allows:
- Seamless access without accounts

## 🤖 AI USAGE LIMIT & ANTI-ABUSE PROTECTION

To maintain **AI stability, performance, and fair usage**, CyberCarnage enforces:

- ⛔ **4 AI messages per user session**  
- 🔒 Rate-limiting per UUID + fingerprint + IP  
- 🧠 Prevents AI overload, hanging, or misuse  
- ⚡ Ensures consistent AI response quality  

Once the limit is reached:
